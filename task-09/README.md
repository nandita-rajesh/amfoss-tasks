This was one of my most favorite tasks. I installed Flutter and Android Studio, setup the virtual device emulator. This was the first problem I faced. Using the virtual device emulator caused my device to heat up real quick and most applications to stop responding. So, I switched to a physical device. I watched a few videos and referred to various online sources to understand Flutter, started coding and integrated the JSON file provided into my code. Another issue I faced was concerning navigation, especially the Favorites tab button, which threw an exception regarding route generation. After correcting the errors in my code, my app was ready to go.
