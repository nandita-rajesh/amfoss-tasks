## Introduction
Ten tasks were assigned to us for this year's amFOSS praveshan. Completing all of these tasks was really fun and enjoyable. However, I think my favorite and most interesting project was building the superhero encyclopedia app using Flutter. Although the process was difficult, the satisfaction in the end made it one of the most fulfilling projects I've ever worked on.


## Technical details
The assigned task was to develop a user-friendly superhero encyclopedia application with Flutter that is highly responsive to searches, includes detailed hero profiles, allows dynamic filtering, and also includes a tab for favorite superheroes. More than just coding, the project aimed at providing a pleasurable experience for fans of superheroes.

I needed to install Flutter and Android Studio on my system and set up the virtual device emulator. Being just another framework to write software across platforms allowed me to create an interface with its own characteristics in respect to adaptability.

I used the JSON file that was provided with detailed information about over 700 superheroes, including superpowers, appearances, biographies, work history, and connections. This information would be parsed and interpreted to get dynamically rendered in the application.

To ensure that there was a continuous and interactive user interface, I had to implement the provider package. This helped in controlling the state of the app with regard to user interactions like adding or removing heroes from the Favorites tab. The use of ChangeNotifier and Consumer widgets ensured that the interface was always up-to-date.

One of the features to be implemented was the dynamic filtering of the heroes by heroes, villains, or anti-heroes. Watching the application adjust to a user's preferences was truly satisfying.

An issue I faced was concerning navigation, especially the Favorites tab button, which threw an exception regarding route generation. This is one of the moments that deepened my understanding of Flutter's navigation system and error handling.


## Thoughts and Experience
As mentioned in the beginning, this project was fun to work on while at the same time frustrating and challenging as well. Every problem I faced in building this app has helped me to understand the Flutter framework better, and it has drawn me towards it. By designing the app from a user's point of view, it ensured that it was not only functional and effective, but also easy to use.


## Conclusion
Looking back on this task, I realize that it has pushed me into new areas of Flutter, increased my knowledge in app development, and given me a project I am proud to have completed. This experience also helped me reaffirm my passion for software development.
