## Introduction
Ten tasks were assigned to us for this year's amFOSS praveshan. Completing all of these tasks was really fun and enjoyable. However, I think my favorite and most interesting project wstood out as it challenged me in ways I hadn't expected and let me combine my creativity and technical knowledge.


## Technical details
The assigned task was to develop a user-friendly superhero encyclopedia application with Flutter that is highly responsive to searches, includes detailed hero profiles, allows dynamic filtering, and also includes a tab for favorite superheroes. More than just coding, the project aimed at providing a pleasurable experience for fans of superheroes.

1. Setting Up Flutter and Android Studio: To begin, I installed Flutter and Android Studio on my system and set up a virtual device emulator. Flutter's cross-platform capabilities allowed me to create a responsive and adaptable interface with a unique look and feel.

2. Data Handling with JSON: I used the JSON file provide, containing detailed information about over 700 superheroes, including superpowers, appearances, biographies, work history, and connections. Parsing this data dynamically was essential for rendering detailed hero profiles in real time.

3. State Management with the Provider Package: To maintain a continuous and interactive user interface, I implemented the `provider` package. This package helped manage the app's state, particularly when users interacted with features like adding or removing heroes from the Favorites tab. The use of `ChangeNotifier` and `Consumer` widgets ensured the app's interface remained up-to-date.

4. Dynamic Filtering of Heroes: One of the most satisfying features to implement was dynamic filtering based on hero alignment â€” whether they are heroes, villains, or anti-heroes. Watching the application adjust dynamically to user preferences highlighted the power and flexibility of Flutter.

5. Navigational Challenges: A key challenge was an issue with the Favorites tab button, which threw an exception related to route generation. Debugging this problem deepened my understanding of Flutter's navigation system and improved my error-handling skills.


## Thoughts and Experience
As mentioned in the beginning, this project was fun to work on while at the same time frustrating and challenging as well. Every problem I faced in building this app has helped me to understand the Flutter framework better, and it has drawn me towards it. By designing the app from a user's point of view, it ensured that it was not only functional and effective, but also easy to use.


## Conclusion
Looking back on this task, I realize that it has pushed me into new areas of Flutter, increased my knowledge in app development, and given me a project I am proud to have completed. This experience also helped me reaffirm my passion for software development.
